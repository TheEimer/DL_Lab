## Exercises for the deep learning lab 2017 ## 
### Exercise 1: ###
Implement a feed-forward net from scratch and train it on MNIST data
### Exercise 2: ###
Use tensorflow to compare learning rates and the runtime of different numbers of filters on a CNN
### Exercise 3: ###
Train a CNN to solve a labyrinth task using supervised learning. Check how well the agent deals with changing environments (spoiler: not well).
### Exercise 4: ###
Use Q-Learning to try and improve generalization performance from exercise 3.
